                    I am a marketing professional, UX Designer and adventure photographer based out of Atlanta, GA. Currently I work as the Marketing Coordinator for Georgia State Parks and Historic Sites. 

                    After graduating from Denison University in 2017, I worked as a Park Ranger in different locations around Georgia for two years. While I loved working for the parks service, I had a desire to pursue my creative interests in design. I am finishing up my UX/UI Certification from Georgia Tech in February.
